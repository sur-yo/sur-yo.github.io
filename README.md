# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Suryo

**Programmer | Problem Solver | Coffee Enthusiast**

I build web apps, backend services, and databases that actually *work*.  
Currently crafting projects in **Go**, **MongoDB**, **Firestore**, **PHP**, and more.

---

## ðŸš€ Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Go, PHP, JavaScript
- **Databases:** MongoDB, Firestore, MySQL

---

## ðŸ“‚ What Iâ€™ve Been Working On
Over time, Iâ€™ve explored:
- Building scalable Go APIs with MongoDB connections.
- Writing clean database access layers (`models`, `routes`, `handlers`, `factory`).
- Querying Firestore with complex filters (array-contains, map key queries).
- PHP forms, modals, and MySQL integration.
- Small UI tweaks that make big UX differences.
